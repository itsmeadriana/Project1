# Soundtracker
### Made with love by Matthew Sievers, Adriana Nieves, Vincent Rivera, and Megha Samala
---

This project is a website that allows users to search for a movie and returns the soundtrack list, complete with lyrics and a Youtube video (or video link) for each song. By consolidating all of this information into one place, Soundtracker eliminates the need to use Shazam in the middle of watching a movie or to scour Google and Youtube for each song.

USER STORY:

- SO THAT I can listen to them on my own

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- GIVEN I am searching for a movie
- WHEN I type in a movie title
- THEN I am presented with search results (list of movies with that title)
- WHEN I click on the movie search result
- THEN I am given the movie’s soundtrack track list
- WHEN I click on an individual track
- THEN I will get a modal with a link to the song lyrics
