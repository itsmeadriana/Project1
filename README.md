# Soundtracker

# Purpose:

This website allows users to search for a movie and returns its soundtrack list, as well as lyrics and a YouTube video (as available) for each track. By consolidating all of this information into one place, soundtracker eliminates the need to use Shazam in the middle of watching a movie or to scour Google and YouTube for each song.

## USER STORY:

- AS A user I WANT to know what songs are playing in the movie I’m watching
- SO THAT I can listen to them on my own

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

- GIVEN I am searching for a movie
- WHEN I type in a movie title
- THEN I am presented with search results (list of movies with that title)
- WHEN I click on the movie search result
- THEN I am given the movie’s soundtrack track list
- WHEN I click on an individual track
- THEN I will get a modal with a link to the song lyrics
